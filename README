Linux kernel: Experimental support for Amlogic SC2 (S905X4)
===========================================================

This is based on vendor drivers found in https://github.com/khadas/linux/tree/khadas-vims-5.4.y-fc.
It works fine on a HK1 RBOX X4 (Android TV Box) that according to uboot is based on the ah212 reference board.

Remarks:
- The vendor uboot serial console runs at 921600bps. The series includes a patch that allows to use the
  same speed for UART ports under Linux.

- Vendor uboot uses a partition called "env" for storing the environment.
  Therefore create a small GPT partition labeled "env" on the eMMC card, it doesn't need a file system.
  Then you can store own variables or redefine existing ones.

- Video output isn't supported, you can access the system via serial console or via network.

- I use ethernet only. I was able to successfully scan for WiFi networks, therefore presumably
  WiFi works. But I didn't test it further.
  
- Regulators in the DT are just dummies because I have no access to board documentation.

- The series adds SDIO interrupt support to the Meson GX driver.
  
What works for me:
- Ethernet
- USB (USB2 and USB3 ports)
- eMMC
- SD card
- 7 segment display (controller is FD6551). I created an experimental driver, controller programming
  information was derived from the openvfd project.
- The bifrost GPU is detected by the panfrost driver.
- CPU frequency scaling seems to work.
- Thermal sensors for CPU and RAM. I see 45°C-50°C on an idle system (closed box, CPU has a small heatsink).
